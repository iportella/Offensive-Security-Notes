# üõ†Ô∏è Network Protocol Vulnerabilities / Vulnerabilidades dos Protocolos de Rede

Este documento apresenta uma vis√£o geral das principais vulnerabilidades em protocolos de rede amplamente utilizados, junto de recomenda√ß√µes pr√°ticas para mitiga√ß√£o.

This document presents an overview of the most common vulnerabilities in widely used network protocols, along with practical mitigation recommendations.

## üì° RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
RDP is widely used for remote desktop access in corporate environments. It typically operates on port **3389**.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Weak credentials**: reused or weak passwords are easily brute-forced.
- **Exposed port**: facilitates man-in-the-middle/on-path attacks.
- **BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708)**: wormable vulnerability allowing remote code execution.

**Recommendations:**
- Use VPN for secure remote access.
- Block port 3389 for unauthorized IPs.
- Regularly audit firewall rules and perform penetration testing.

## üîê SSH (Secure Shell)
Secure terminal access protocol, typically running on port **22**.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unprotected SSH keys**: may allow unauthorized access.
- **Lateral movement**: attackers abuse persistent trust relationships.
- **Uncontrolled environments**: backdoors via misconfigured OpenSSH.

**Recommendations:**
- Enforce strong authentication.
- Restrict access via VPN.
- Regularly audit authorized SSH keys.

## üåê HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
Web foundational protocol, operates on port **80**, inherently insecure.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Clear-text transmission**: susceptible to sniffing.
- **Code injection**: lack of encryption increases risk.

**Recommendations:**
- Use HTTPS with TLS.
- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

## üìÅ FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Legacy file transfer protocol, usually on port **21**.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Clear-text**: credentials and files transmitted unencrypted.
- **Brute-force attacks**: common on poorly configured servers.
- **Bounce attack**: port manipulation allows scanning and bypassing firewalls.

**Recommendations:**
- Use SFTP or FTPS.
- Block port 21 if unused.

## üß∑ SMBv1 (Server Message Block v1)
Outdated protocol version, usually over port **445**.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **EternalBlue (WannaCry)**: remote code execution exploit.
- **Null sessions**: anonymous enumeration of users and shares.
- **No encryption**: file and metadata transmitted in clear-text.

**Recommendations:**
- Disable SMBv1.
- Use SMBv2/v3 with authentication and encryption.

## üñ•Ô∏è Telnet
Legacy remote terminal protocol, typically over port **23**.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Clear-text communication**: exposes usernames/passwords.
- **Botnets (e.g., Mirai)**: propagation vector.
- **Suspicious activity**: often associated with malware.

**Recommendations:**
- Replace with SSH.
- Block Telnet access via firewall.

## üìö LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
Used for authentication and directory services over port **389**.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unencrypted traffic**: data including credentials sent in clear-text.
- **LDAP injection**: query manipulation to gain unauthorized access.
- **Anonymous binds**: allows login without credentials.

**Recommendations:**
- Use TLS (LDAPS) to secure communication.
- Disable anonymous binds.
- Sanitize and validate user input.
